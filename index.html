I came across this game, it was unlike any game I've played before. Adventure, strategy, thrills, it had just the right amount of everything, it was divine. I played for days without eating or sleeping until my body gave out. A few days later when I tried to find the game again, it was nowhere to be found. I have searched most of my life for this game - the greatest game I've ever played to no avail. Now I have created this game before you. This is not, the greatest game in the world, oh no. This is just a tribute. Couldn't remember, the greatest game in the world. No, this is just a tribute.</p>
